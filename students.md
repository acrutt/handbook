It's important that you establish California residency early in your first semester. If you don't complete the necessary tasks on time, you will be classified as a out-of-state student for the following academic year. Although the deadline for filing your Statement of Legal Residence (SLR) is in June, you must complete all necessary conditions for residency (getting your CA drivers license, registering your car in CA, etc) **before the end of your first semester.**

>To satisfy the union of physical presence and intent, legal indicia of intent should be acquired and all out-of-state legal indicia relinquished at least 366 days prior to the term for which a resident classification is requested. However, the University allows a limited period of time within the 366-day requirement to obtain legal indicia of intent and relinquish all ties to the past place of residence. For students either newly enrolling or continuing enrollment at UC who are requesting a resident classification for the Fall 2019 term, California legal intent must have been established and all out-of-state legal intent relinquished prior to the end of the Fall 2018 term.
