        Berkeley and the surrounding areas are wonderful places to live, but finding an apartment can be difficult and is best done with knowledge of the various neighborhoods. How? See looking for housing.

## After You Arrive <a name="after"></a>
Welcome to Berkeley! Here is a checklist of things you should complete within your first week:

* Set up your computer. See [SETTING UP YOUR COMPUTER]() on how to do this and some recommended software to install.
* Complete the checklist that HR gives you in your welcome package. Note: postdocs cannot select retirement plans; an obligatory UCRS DCP is deducted from your pre-tax salary each month but the money belongs to you.
* Complete all LBNL/UC Berkeley training courses including the ergonomic self-assessment.
* Send an email to Donny Winston with a headshot for the group website and a request to be added to the group email list. Use the subject line "Onboarding: <YOUR NAME>".
* Set up the employee wifi. Note that the visitor wifi is open access. To connect to employee wifi, go to https://software.lbl.gov/, search for “Wireless Networking”, and download the configuration file. 
* Request access to the group’s Google Drive folder.
* Install the lab VPN for connecting to the lab network from home. For example, this lets you download research articles from home. See https://software.lbl.gov for instructions on installation.
* Obtain user accounts for any computing resources (LINK) you may be using.
* Orient yourself with LBL's calendar system (Google Calendar) and determine when the next group meeting is. 
* Obtain a license for any software packages you might be using. For example, you may need to be added to the VASP users list (for VASP, you should also register for the forum.)
* Get connected to the printer. The printer is located in 143C and instructions for how to connect can be found [here.](https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/perssongroup/printers-in-persson-group) Julian Self is the current printer czar and can advise you if you are having any difficulties.
* Request after-hours access to the lab. By default, you will not have off-hours site access to building 33, i.e., on weekends, holidays, and from ~6pm to 7am on weekdays. To obtain off-hours site access, email the ESDR admin (esdradmin@lbl.gov), tell them you need after-hours building access, and cc Kristin.
* Ask to read the proposal that funds your work. This will help explain the impact of your project, the long-term plans and goals, and how your project fits in with other efforts.
* Work with Alice Muller to update your name tag outside your office.

### Getting situated in your office <a name="office"></a>
Please feel free to decorate your lab space with photos, posters, or other personal touches. Order any peripherals that will help you work more efficiently and comfortably including keyboards, mice, ergonomic devices such as wrist pads, and external displays.
