## Information for Students

### Information for out-of-state students

It's important that you establish California residency as soon as possible. If you don't complete the necessary tasks on time, you will be classified as a out-of-state student for the following academic year. Although the deadline for filing your Statement of Legal Residence (SLR) is usually in June, you must complete the necessary tasks (getting your CA drivers license, re-regitering your car in CA, etc) **before the end of your first semester.**

>To satisfy the union of physical presence and intent, legal indicia of intent should be acquired and all out-of-state legal >indicia relinquished at least 366 days prior to the term for which a resident classification is requested. However, the >University allows a limited period of time within the 366-day requirement to obtain legal indicia of intent and relinquish >all ties to the past place of residence. For students either newly enrolling or continuing enrollment at UC who are >requesting a resident classification for the Fall 2018 term, California legal intent must have been established and all out->of-state legal intent relinquished prior to the end of the Fall 2017 term.
