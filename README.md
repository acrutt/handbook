# The Persson Group Handbook

This website serves as the group handbook for the [Persson Group](http://perssongroup.lbl.gov) at the University of California, Berkeley / Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The handbook contains useful information for new students and post-docs joining the group, and has answers to many frequently asked questions. You are encouraged to contribute to this handbook via the [open-source repo.](http://perssongroup.lbl.gov)

## About the Group

Our group studies the physics and chemistry of materials using atomistic computational methods and high-performance computing technology. Most of our research is focused on materials for energy applications, such as battery electrode materials, electrolytes, photocatalysts, thermoelectrics, etc. We are co-located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and the University of California, Berkeley, just down the hill from LBNL. Our main workspaces are located at LBNL, but we have a number of additional desks available on campus for students to use in between classes, which are located in the grad bay of Hearst Memorial Mining Building. San Francisco is located across the bay from Berkeley and is about a 30 minute drive or BART train ride away. Berkeley itself is a vibrant city of 115,000 people filled with cafes, restaurants of all types, and cultural activities.

## Before You Arrive

Although many things can only be taken care of after arriving at LBNL, here are a few simple things you should do in advance.

### Join Slack 
[![Slack logo](./resources/slack-logo.png)](){: .image-left target="_blank", height="50px"} Slack is a messaging app that we use extensively to communicate both within our group with our Materials Project collaborators. To join our [slack channel](https://berkeleytheory.slack.com), you'll need to use your @lbl.gov email address.

## Information for New Graduate Students

### If you're coming from another state/country

It's important that you establish California residency early in your first semester. If you don't complete the necessary tasks on time, you will be classified as a out-of-state student for the following academic year. Although the deadline for filing your Statement of Legal Residence (SLR) is in June, you must complete all necessary conditions for residency (getting your CA drivers license, registering your car in CA, etc) **before the end of your first semester.**

>To satisfy the union of physical presence and intent, legal indicia of intent should be acquired and all out-of-state legal indicia relinquished at least 366 days prior to the term for which a resident classification is requested. However, the University allows a limited period of time within the 366-day requirement to obtain legal indicia of intent and relinquish all ties to the past place of residence. For students either newly enrolling or continuing enrollment at UC who are requesting a resident classification for the Fall 2019 term, California legal intent must have been established and all out-of-state legal intent relinquished prior to the end of the Fall 2018 term.
