# Persson Group Handbook

This is the repo for the Persson Group's handbook site, which contains useful information for postdocs and students. The site is hosted on Github Pages, which is powered by Jekyll. 

## Contributing
To contribute to the handbook, please fork this repo and make your changes in that branch. After you are happy with your changes, submit a pull request with a short note about the changes you made and merge it. Persson group members should feel free to merge your own pull requests. 

## How to add content to the site
Each page on the site is a markdown file in this repo (i.e. "students.md" specifies the content that is found at perssongroup.github/io/handbook/students). To add content to a page, all you have to do is edit that markdown file. You can find a nice markdown tutorial here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
