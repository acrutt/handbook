### Postdoc union <a name="union"></a>

Note that Berkeley postdocs have unionized with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America to obtain collective bargaining agreements. Joining the union is an option, and many of the details are present here:  http://uaw5810.org

You can also message the Slack group to get opinions from the current postdocs in the group.

### Leave Time Reporting
You should coordinate the specific days of vacation and personal time off with Kristin, especially for an extended absence.

#### LBL Postdocs <a name="lblvacay"></a>
Postdocs will receive a set number of vacation / personal time off (PTO) days that will be outlined in your hiring package. For union postdocs, the union has currently negotiated 24 PTO days per year along with other benefits.

#### Berkeley Postdocs <a name="ucbvacay"></a>
As a new ostdoc, you should submit a Postdoc time sheet each month to the Payroll team at 197M Cory Hall, ersopayroll@erso.berkeley.edu. This time sheet is used only to record the Personal Time Off and Sick Leave that you use. According to UC Postdoc policy, you are granted 24 days of Personal Time Off and 12 days of Sick Leave per 12-month appointment.

On your [first time sheet](http://www.erso.berkeley.edu/erso/sites/default/files/uploads/Postdoc_Timesheet.pdf) you will need to manually type your beginning balance of 24 PTO days and 12 Sick Days. Any paid days off should be recorded on your time sheet and subtracted from your balance.
