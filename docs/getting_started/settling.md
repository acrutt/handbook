# Information for Graduate Students <a name="students"></a>

## New students coming from another state/country <a name="slr"></a>
It's important that you establish California residency early in your first semester. If you don't complete the necessary tasks on time, you will be classified as a out-of-state student for the following academic year. Although the deadline for filing your Statement of Legal Residence (SLR) is in June, you must complete all necessary conditions for residency (getting your CA drivers license, registering your car in CA, etc) **before the end of your first semester.**

>To satisfy the union of physical presence and intent, legal indicia of intent should be acquired and all out-of-state legal indicia relinquished at least 366 days prior to the term for which a resident classification is requested. However, the University allows a limited period of time within the 366-day requirement to obtain legal indicia of intent and relinquish all ties to the past place of residence. For students either newly enrolling or continuing enrollment at UC who are requesting a resident classification for the Fall 2019 term, California legal intent must have been established and all out-of-state legal intent relinquished prior to the end of the Fall 2018 term.

# Information for Postdocs <a name="postdocs"></a>

Berkeley Lab offers many resources for postdoc. See for example:

[http://postdocresources.lbl.gov](http://postdocresources.lbl.gov)

[https://postdoc.berkeley.edu/resources](https://postdoc.berkeley.edu/resources)

## Postdoc union <a name="union"></a>

Note that Berkeley postdocs have unionized with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America to obtain collective bargaining agreements. Joining the union is an option, and many of the details are present here:  http://uaw5810.org

You can also message the Slack group to get opinions from the current postdocs in the group.

## Leave Time Reporting
You should coordinate the specific days of vacation and personal time off with Kristin, especially for an extended absence.

### LBL Postdocs <a name="lblvacay"></a>
Postdocs will receive a set number of vacation / personal time off (PTO) days that will be outlined in your hiring package. For union postdocs, the union has currently negotiated 24 PTO days per year along with other benefits.

### Berkeley Postdocs <a name="ucbvacay"></a>
As a new postdoc, you should submit a Postdoc time sheet each month to the Payroll team at 197M Cory Hall, ersopayroll@erso.berkeley.edu. This time sheet is used only to record the Personal Time Off and Sick Leave that you use. According to UC Postdoc policy, you are granted 24 days of Personal Time Off and 12 days of Sick Leave per 12-month appointment.

On your [first time sheet](http://www.erso.berkeley.edu/erso/sites/default/files/uploads/Postdoc_Timesheet.pdf) you will need to manually type your beginning balance of 24 PTO days and 12 Sick Days. Any paid days off should be recorded on your time sheet and subtracted from your balance.
