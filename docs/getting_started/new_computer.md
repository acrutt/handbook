## Getting a Computer <a name="getcomputer"></a>

Most long-term appointments (graduate student, postdoc, staff) will mean purchasing a new computer. Short-term appointments (e.g., internships) will not involve a computer purchase unless otherwise stated - you can instead receive an excellent computer from the group’s stock.

### Mac, Windows, or Linux?
You are advised to buy a Mac, and probably a Macbook Pro. In our experience these are the best systems for our type of work.

### Purchasing

#### LBNL Funded Members
* Use LBNL Ebuy (not Ebay) wherever possible - you need to be on the lab network (onsite via an ethernet cable) or be connected via the VPN
* Use Amazon, etc. to buy various components if not available via EBuy
* The laptop is government property; you are expected to return it to the group when you are done working at LBNL. Note that Mac computers make it very simple to transfer everything over to your next computer.
* You are free to take your laptop home, on trips, etc., unless you are an intern in which case other restrictions may apply from the internship program.
* The lab receives your computer and tags it before sending it over to you.
* You must back up your computer very regularly (at least once per week, ideally continuously). This is simple using the Time Machine app. Just plug your backup drive into your monitor so when you connect to your monitor, you also back up. If there are (for some reason) errors in backing up, fix that issue immediately. There are zero excuses for not doing this.

#### UCB Funded Members
* Use BearBuy
* More details coming to this documentation soon.

### Selecting a computer, monitor, and accessories
Your computer workstation is one area where you should get whatever you think will make you most productive. As you'll be working on this setup the majority of your time in the group, please don't worry too much about the cost here.

For the computer, you should select a Macbook Pro (any screen size) as mentioned above. You can use the Apple website to browse details. Many of us use a 13” Macbook Pro. It is powerful enough to do serious work and light/small enough to use on a plane. A 15” Macbook Pro is also a good choice. If you would like to get anything other than a Macbook Pro, talk to some senior members of the group first to get their input.

For the monitor, a number of us use a single Thunderbolt display. While this is no longer available for purchase, there may be one or two floating around the group that you can adopt. Another good option available is the LG 27MU88-W (4K resolution) monitor which is on Ebuy. Note that one big screen is usually better ergonomically than dual monitors, and you can use the “Spaces” feature of Mac OS/X to quickly flip between virtual screens if needed. If you'd like a second monitor, we have a number of them floating around the group and one can probably be found for you.

For accessories, make sure to get:
* An extra charger
* A VGA adapter dongle
* An ethernet cable adapter dongle
* A Time Machine hard disk (for backup). 4TB is a good size. There is a usb-c G-Drive that also doubles as a charger that some of us enjoy.
* A keyboard. The Apple Wireless Keyboard is a good option. Others prefer mechanical keyboards and some prefer to use the loudest keyboard that they can find (Shyam). If you prefer a larger or ergonomic keyboard, you can certainly get that.
* A mouse/trackpad. We suggest Apple Magic Trackpad because Mac OS has customized a lot of the interface for the trackpad (e.g., gestures). Some also value consistency between their laptop and desk workstation. After a while you get used to doing everything on your trackpad even if you were previously very productive/accurate with a mouse on Windows. However, many of us get by just fine with a mouse (especially the Apple Magic Mouse, which has some gesture support.)
* (optional) A presentation tool, e.g., Logitech R800.

### Making the purchase
1. Provide all the details of your selections in an email and send to Alice Mueller. If all looks ok, she will give you a project and activity ID.
2. Go to eBuy, and for items available there, add them to your cart and submit the requisition with the project and activity ID. Ask Alice Mueller about which SAS approver to list if you are unsure (the SAS approver can vary by project and activity ID).
3. For items not available on eBuy, contact esdradmin@lbl.gov (and cc Kristin and Alice) to obtain a procurement form. Fill it out with item details (Vendor, website, price, etc.) and send it back.
4. If you select the overnight shipping option (ask Kristin about this and the related extra costs) most parts, except the computer, will arrive within a week to 10 days. The computer needs to be tagged by the lab, so with overnight shipping, it should arrive within 2 weeks. Ideally, you will select your computer well before arriving at the lab and won’t need overnight shipping.
