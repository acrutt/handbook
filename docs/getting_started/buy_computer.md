# Getting a Computer <a name="getcomputer"></a>

Most long-term appointments (graduate student, postdoc, staff) will mean purchasing a new computer. Short-term appointments (e.g., internships) will not involve a computer purchase unless otherwise stated - you can instead receive an excellent computer from the group’s stock.

### Mac, Windows, or Linux?
You are advised to buy a Macbook Pro. In our experience these are the best systems for our type of work and having similar hardware and operating systems can make it easier to collaborate on code and help other group members. If you would like to get anything other than a Macbook Pro, talk to more senior group members first to get their input.

You can use the Apple website to browse details and see what is available in through the supplier, Anacapa, in Ebuy and Bearbuy. Many group members use a 13” or 15" Macbook Pro. The 13" is powerful enough to do serious work and is lighter and smaller than the 15" for improved mobility. However, the most powerful computing hardware is typically only available in the 15" if you want to prioritize performance. 

### Making the purchase
1. Provide all the details of your selections in an email and send to Alice Mueller. If all looks ok, she will give you a project and activity ID.
2. Go to eBuy, and for items available there, add them to your cart and submit the requisition with the project and activity ID. Ask Alice Mueller about which SAS approver to list if you are unsure (the SAS approver can vary by project and activity ID).
3. For items not available on eBuy, contact esdradmin@lbl.gov (and cc Kristin and Alice) to obtain a procurement form. Fill it out with item details (Vendor, website, price, etc.) and send it back.
4. If you select the overnight shipping option (ask Kristin about this and the related extra costs) most parts, except the computer, will arrive within a week to 10 days. The computer needs to be tagged by the lab, so with overnight shipping, it should arrive within 2 weeks. Ideally, you will select your computer well before arriving at the lab and won’t need overnight shipping.
