# Before You Arrive <a name="before"></a>

A member of the Persson Group Onboarding Team will reach out before your expected start date to share this group handbook and coordinate other onboarding efforts to welcome you to the Persson Group. Although many things can only be taken care of after arriving at LBNL, here are a few simple things you can do in advance. 

If you have not been contacted by the Persson Group Onboarding Team at least one week before your arrival, please reach out to Christian  Legaspi and Ann Rutt (contact information is on the Persson Group website in Useful Quick Links below). We do our best, but there may have been a miscommunication or oversight on our end if no one has not reached out two weeks before your expected start date.

## Work Scope and Hiring Details <a name="before"></a>

Several administrative and research details in onboarding are uniquie to each group member. Some of this information may have been communicated during your hiring process, but please reach out to Kristin (or members of the Persson Group Onboarding Team) if you are unsure about any of the following questions before your arrival:

* What project(s) will I be working on? 
* What funding source will support my work? 
* Will I be hired as a UC Berkeley employee (and LBL affiliate) or LBL employee?
* Which subgroup(s) will I be joining? Who will I be working most closely with? 

Many administrative matters (HR orientation, payroll, purchasing, etc.) will vary depending on if you are a UC Berkeley or LBL employee. This information which help you navigate joining the Persson Group such as understanding which administrative systems you will use and who can help you become orientated with your research/work.

## Order a Computer <a name="before"></a>

Most long-term appointments (graduate student, postdoc, staff) will mean purchasing a new computer. It typically takes at least 2 weeks for a computer to arrive. To avoid delays once you start from waiting to recieve your computer, you can make arrangements to order one in advance. Work with Alice Muller to handle the purchase (your access to purchasing resources is granted after your arrival). Visit the [Getting a Computer](/getting_started/buy_computer.md) section of the handbook for group guidelines on computer selection and purchasing.

Short-term appointments (e.g., internships) will not involve a computer purchase unless otherwise stated. You can instead receive an excellent computer from the groupâ€™s stock.
