# Before You Arrive <a name="before"></a>

A member of the Persson Group Onboarding Team will reach out before your expected start date to share this group handbook and coordinate other onboarding efforts to welcome you to the Persson Group. Although many things can only be taken care of after arriving at LBNL, here are a few simple things you should do in advance.

Most long-term appointments (graduate student, postdoc, staff) will mean purchasing a new computer. It typically takes at least 2 weeks for a computer to arrive. To avoid delay in recieving your computer, so you can make arrangements to order one in advance before your start day. To purchase a new computer, visit the [Getting a Computer](/getting_started/buy_computer.md)  section of the handbook.

Short-term appointments (e.g., internships) will not involve a computer purchase unless otherwise stated - you can instead receive an excellent computer from the groupâ€™s stock.
