## Before You Arrive <a name="before"></a>

Although many things can only be taken care of after arriving at LBNL, here are a few simple things you should do in advance.

# Join Slack

Slack is a messaging app that we use extensively to communicate both within our group and with our Materials Project collaborators. To join our [slack channel](https://berkeleytheory.slack.com), you'll need to use your <name>@lbl.gov email address.

# Getting a Computer

Most long-term appointments (graduate student, postdoc, staff) will mean purchasing a new computer. To purchase a new computer, visit the [new computer section](/new_computer.md) of the handbook.

Short-term appointments (e.g., internships) will not involve a computer purchase unless otherwise stated - you can instead receive an excellent computer from the groupâ€™s stock.

See below for recommended equipment and computers. Once you have selected your computer, head over to [purchasing](../policies/purchasing.md) for information on placing your order.
