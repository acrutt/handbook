### Selecting a computer, monitor, and accessories
Your computer workstation is one area where you should get whatever you think will make you most productive. As you'll be working on this setup the majority of your time in the group, please don't worry too much about the cost here.

For the computer, you should select a Macbook Pro (any screen size) as mentioned above. You can use the Apple website to browse details. Many of us use a 13” Macbook Pro. It is powerful enough to do serious work and light/small enough to use on a plane. A 15” Macbook Pro is also a good choice. If you would like to get anything other than a Macbook Pro, talk to some senior members of the group first to get their input.

For the monitor, a number of us use a single Thunderbolt display. While this is no longer available for purchase, there may be one or two floating around the group that you can adopt. Another good option available is the LG 27MU88-W (4K resolution) monitor which is on Ebuy. Note that one big screen is usually better ergonomically than dual monitors, and you can use the “Spaces” feature of Mac OS/X to quickly flip between virtual screens if needed. If you'd like a second monitor, we have a number of them floating around the group and one can probably be found for you.

For accessories, make sure to get:

* An extra charger

* A VGA adapter dongle

* An ethernet cable adapter dongle

* A Time Machine hard disk (for backup). 4TB is a good size. There is a usb-c G-Drive that also doubles as a charger that some of us enjoy.

* A keyboard. The Apple Wireless Keyboard is a good option. Others prefer mechanical keyboards and some prefer to use the loudest keyboard that they can find (Shyam). If you prefer a larger or ergonomic keyboard, you can certainly get that.

* A mouse/trackpad. We suggest Apple Magic Trackpad because Mac OS has customized a lot of the interface for the trackpad (e.g., gestures). Some also value consistency between their laptop and desk workstation. After a while you get used to doing everything on your trackpad even if you were previously very productive/accurate with a mouse on Windows. However, many of us get by just fine with a mouse (especially the Apple Magic Mouse, which has some gesture support.)

* (optional) A presentation tool, e.g., Logitech R800.
