# Setting Up Your Workspace

An effective workspace should help maximize your productivity. You will spend a great deal of time working in this space so it is worth investing in any equipment needed to increase your efficiency and comfort. An optimal set-up is essential for making sure you can contribute your best work. So if you will use it, buy it. Don't worry so much about if you "need" vs. "want" it.

While we want to be conscious of cost and avoid wastefulness, anything that helps improve your work (whether in saving time, automating tedious daily tasks, better reliability, etc.) adds value which outweighs the initial financial cost. Remember, just as experimental groups invest their resources in chemicals, new lab instruments, equipment time, etc. to do their research, as computationalists, we invest in office items, software, computers, and other related tools that will make our group members more effective.


## Computer Monitors

Note that one big screen is usually better ergonomically than dual monitors, and you can use the “Spaces” feature of Mac OS/X to quickly flip between virtual screens if needed. 


## Recommended Computer Accessories

* An extra computer charger

* A VGA and HDMI adapter dongle

* An ethernet cable adapter dongle

* A Time Machine hard disk (for backup). 4TB is a good size. There is a usb-c G-Drive that also doubles as a charger that some of us enjoy.

* A keyboard. The Apple Wireless Keyboard is a good option. Others prefer mechanical keyboards and some prefer to use the loudest keyboard that they can find (Shyam). If you prefer a larger or ergonomic keyboard, you can certainly get that.

* A mouse/trackpad. We suggest Apple Magic Trackpad because Mac OS has customized a lot of the interface for the trackpad (e.g., gestures). Some also value consistency between their laptop and desk workstation. After a while you get used to doing everything on your trackpad even if you were previously very productive/accurate with a mouse on Windows. However, many of us get by just fine with a mouse (especially the Apple Magic Mouse, which has some gesture support.)

* A presentation tool or clicker, e.g., Logitech R800 (optional)
