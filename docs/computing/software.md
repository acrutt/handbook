## Our software stack
A brief summary of our software stack includes:

* [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen) / [pymatgen-db](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen-db) - for representing and analyzing crystal structures, as well as setting up/performing manual calculations

* [FireWorks](https://github.com/materialsproject/fireworks) - for executing and managing calculation workflows at supercomputing centers

* [custodian](https://github.com/materialsproject/custodian) - instead of directly running an executable like VASP, one can wrap the executable in custodian to detect and fix errors

* [atomate](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/atomate) - for quickly defining multiple types of materials science workflows

* [matminer](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer) - for large data analysis and visualization

We also heavily use the Materials Project database.
------------------

Additional software used by many members of our group include:

* [VESTA](http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/) -

* [Ovito](https://www.ovito.org/) -

* [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) -

* [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/download/) -

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) -

* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) -

To learn how to use the software stack, you can consult the documentation of the individual codebases as well as review the following resources:

* The 2018 Materials Project workshop (note that MatMethods is now called atomate): [https://github.com/materialsproject/workshop-2018](https://github.com/materialsproject/workshop-2018)

* The 2014 Materials Virtual Lab presentations:
[https://materialsvirtuallab.org/software/](https://materialsvirtuallab.org/software/)

* The Materials Project YouTube tutorials:

If you have a specific question, sometimes the easiest solution is to post it to the Slack group and crowdsource the answer (or just ask Shyam).
